[00:49.12] I want every single piece of you
[00:53.12] I want your heaven and your oceans too
[00:57.70] Treat me soft but touch me cruel
[01:01.69] I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
[01:06.66] Bring the floor up to my knees
[01:10.16] Let me fall into your gravity
[01:14.64] Then kiss me back to life to see
[01:18.81] Your body standing over me
[01:31.81] 
[01:21.97] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[01:25.61] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[01:30.22] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[01:32.74] Lights go down, lights go down
[01:34.54] Lights go down, lights go down
[01:36.91] Down, down, down
[01:44.91] 
[01:40.25] I miss you when the lights go out
[01:44.68] It illuminates all of my doubts
[01:49.03] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[01:55.06] Baby, give me light
[02:04.56] 
[01:57.45] I miss you when the lights go out
[02:01.69] It illuminates all of my doubts
[02:05.92] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[02:11.96] Baby, give me light
[02:21.46] 
[02:31.37] I love the way your body moves
[02:35.45] Towards me from across the room
[02:39.97] Brushing past my every groove
[02:44.00] No one has me like you do, baby
[02:48.67] Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
[02:52.23] But be delicate with my ego
[02:56.20] I wanna step into your great unknown
[03:00.77] With you and me setting the tone
[03:16.77] 
[03:04.15] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[03:07.72] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[03:11.90] Baby, don't let the lights go down
[03:14.65] Lights go down, lights go down
[03:16.81] Lights go down, lights go down
[03:19.17] Down, down, down
[03:27.17] 
[03:22.11] I miss you when the lights go out
[03:26.36] It illuminates all of my doubts
[03:30.88] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[03:36.79] Baby, give me light
[03:46.29] 
[03:39.47] I miss you when the lights go out
[03:43.50] It illuminates all of my doubts
[03:47.83] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[03:53.71] Baby, give me light
[04:03.21] 
[03:58.01] We play so dirty in the dark
[04:06.18] 'Cause we are living worlds apart
[04:14.30] It only makes it harder, baby
[04:20.75] It only makes it harder, baby (harder, baby)
[04:23.95] Harder, baby (harder, baby), harder, baby
[04:44.45] 
[04:30.35] I miss you when the lights go out
[04:34.55] It illuminates all of my doubts
[04:38.98] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[04:45.02] Baby, give me light
[04:54.52] 
[04:47.42] I miss you when the lights go out
[04:51.43] It illuminates all of my doubts
[04:55.88] Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go
[05:01.73] Baby, give me light
[05:11.23] 
[05:04.51] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:08.03] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:12.13] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:16.38] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:21.17] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:25.05] Ooh (I miss you)
[05:29.39] Ooh (I miss you)
